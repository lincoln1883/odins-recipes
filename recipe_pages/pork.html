		<h1>Stew Pork</h1>
		<img src="/images/stew pork.jpeg" alt="" />
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			A great Jamaican style dish. I love any kind of braised or stewed pork
			recipes, especially ones that have similar ingredients as jerk pork. While
			I might make a few adjustments next time, this really did come out
			amazingly well. Serve over steamed rice with green peas and garnish with
			fresh thyme.
		</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1 to 2 pounds Pork Chops (pressure cook pork chop 8 minutes)</li>
			<li>2 stacks Scallion (diced)</li>
			<li>2 + ½ medium Onions (diced)</li>
			<li>8 cloves Garlic (peeled mashed)</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon Pimento Seeds</li>
			<li>(tie to two fingers) sprig Thyme (fresh)</li>
			<li>1 small Tomatoes</li>
			<li>1 + ½ or 2 tablespoons Sea Salt (use any sea)</li>
			<li>
				1 ripening Pepper (Scotch Bonnet); or Fresh Chili Pepper - cut in half
			</li>
			<li>½ inch Ginger Root (wash it, do not peel) - optional</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon White Vinegar</li>
			<li>
				2 or less tablespoons Browning (if thick use less, add it bit by bit
				until water is brown not black)
			</li>
			<li>½ piece Sweet/Bell Pepper (diced)</li>
			<li>
				1 tablespoon Butter (add near to the end) - optional - I used none
			</li>
			<li>
				2 - 4 tablespoons Coconut Oil (or Olive oil) - use any cooking oil
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Make 2 slices into the skin side of each thigh, perpendicular to the
				bone, about 1 inch apart, cutting all the way down to the bone. Add
				chicken thighs to the marinade and toss thoroughly until evenly coated.
				Place a piece of plastic wrap over the chicken and transfer to the
				refrigerator, 12 hours or overnight. If possible, toss several times
				during the marinating time.
			</li>
			<li>
				Remove the chicken from the marinade. Scrape off any chunks of marinade
				from chicken into the bowl and reserve for later.
			</li>
			<li>
				Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large, deep, heavy-bottomed skillet or Dutch
				oven over medium-high heat until almost smoking hot. Add chicken and
				brown well on both sides, about 5 minutes, working in batches if
				necessary. Once all the chicken is browned, remove to the marinade bowl
				and reserve.
			</li>
			<li>
				Heat the same pan over medium-high heat. Add onion and a pinch of salt;
				saute in the fat until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon
				brown sugar and cook until everything caramelizes and turns a dark
				brown, 3 to 5 minutes more.
			</li>
			<li>
				Carefully add chicken broth, ketchup, and bay leaves to the pan; bring
				to a boil. Add carrots, bell peppers, browned chicken thighs, and
				reserved marinade.
			</li>
			<li>
				Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until
				the chicken is tender and no longer pink in the centers, and the sauce
				has reduced and thickened, 1 to 1 1/2 hours, skimming the excess fat
				that comes to the top and basting the chicken with the sauce
				occasionally. Taste and adjust seasoning. Toss in reserved sliced green
				onions. Serve immediately.
			</li>
		</ol>
